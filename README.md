# express-boilerplate

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/christroutner/express-boilerplate.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a bare-bones express application generated with [this express generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html).
The view engine is Handlebars. I like Handlebars because it's intuitive to work with, allowing easy drop-in HTML.

I use this boilerplate to quickly prototype Express.js based applications and prototypes.
